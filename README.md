# Classic-Algorithms-in-Python

This is my entire 5th semester Algorithm lab codes in python.
Classic algorithms include:
1. Sorting algotihms (performance comparision)
2. Hashing techniques
3. Huffman coding
4. Longest common subsequence
5. Matrix chain multiplication
6. AVL rotation (tree.py)
7. Graph algorithms (Bellman ford, Dijkstra, Kruskal, Prim)
